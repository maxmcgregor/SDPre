      <p><strong>My experience with html has been fine, it's not too challenging. The hard part is navigating the Terminal.</strong></p>

    <h2>HTML Experience Notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The Good Stuff</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Content is very straightforward</li>
          <li>HTML tools are easy to look up</li>
          <li>I'm confident I'll understand because interns take on HTML coding as a part of meaningless intenrships</li>
        </ul>
        <li>The Less Good Stuff</li>
        <ul>
          <li>It seems simple and not challening</li>
          <li>So far it just displays literal words & doesn't do anything cool</li>
          <li>No one seems to acknowledge it as an important language to know, so it feels like my time could be better spent elsewhere.</li>
