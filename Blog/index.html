    <h2>About Max:</h2>
    <p>I'm a 30 year old dude who's been seeking a fitting career path since 2013. After being told repeatedly I'd make a good engineer due to my technical nature, we're finally giving that careerpath a chance and here we are. Also I like dogs.

      <p><strong>My experience with html has been fine, it's not too challenging. The hard part is navigating the Terminal.</strong></p>

    <h2>HTML Experience Notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>The Good Stuff</b></li>
        <ul>
          <li>Content is very straightforward</li>
          <li>HTML tools are easy to look up</li>
          <li>I'm confident I'll understand because interns take on HTML coding as a part of meaningless intenrships</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>The Less Good Stuff</b></li>
        <ul>
          <li>It seems simple and not challening</li>
          <li>So far it just displays literal words & doesn't do anything cool</li>
          <li>No one seems to acknowledge it as an important language to know, so it feels like my time could be better spent elsewhere.</li>
